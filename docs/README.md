## What
This is a work in progress bot for discord. In the time writing this, the bot is only capable of some silly commands.

But it has a great infrastructure to create and deploy a bot in few steps! you can see de details in the full documentation.

## Why
The intention of this project is being a sandbox to experiment technologies, features, and more on a fully productive environment. 

All the development is using free tools and services, so it's a great way to create a discord bot free of charge with high monitoring, infrastructure, CI/CD, etc...


## How

You can check out the full documentation [in this site](https://datocal.github.io/nolocal/)


### Can I fork it and have my own bot?
Sure, that would be ideal.

However, although there is a general documentation explaining all necessary integrations, It may be too hard to install it without an specific guide.

It should be as simple as fork it and change the secrets and environment settings for your own.
