In the time writing this, the bot is only capable of two silly commands. But it has a great infrastructure to create and deploy a bot in few steps! you can see de details in the full documentation. The intention of this project is to create a layer of abstraction between multiple cloud providers to create game servers like minecraft by discord commands. Why There are lots of users that don't know how to create game servers, and the ones who knows how it works will have to go through a complex process to create instances, open them to public, open ports and more. With this solution, once it's configured on your favourite server, you can create instances and start/stop it as you use it, paying the server the time is being used. How The users of this bot will have to configure their clouds accounts through the bot. The bot will create, start and stop instances based on the commands.

It can be registered as a global or a specific server command. This process is not automated, as the time of writing this, the process is as simple as to make a POST request with the command specification. You can check the specific documentation in the following link Programming slash commands Adding commands is pretty straightforward. You just have to create a Spring bean. The name of the bean must be the command to listen. This bean has to implement the following interface: com.datocal.nolocal.infrastructure.commands.DiscordCommand For example, this would be a ping command: @Component(\"ping\") class PingCommand(private val ping: Ping) : DiscordCommand { override fun accept(interaction: Interaction): InteractionResponse { return InteractionResponse(ping.ping()) } } And, for the discord registration to work, it must be documented with the @Command annotation. Description cannot be informed for message commands. @Command( command = \"ping\", description = \"Just a ping command\", type = Command.TYPE_CHAT_INPUT, ) The notation @Component(\"ping\") will create the infrastructure necessary to create the bean and call this Runner when the ping command is invoked. You just have to implement the method returning an InteractionResponse. The notation @Command will add the command to discord at startup if it's not already in the discord configuration. How the magic works The annotation @Component is a spring annotation. For those not familiarized with spring, this will initialize this class calling its constructor and put it in a magic box to take it any time it's needed in a program. In the shadows, Spring will create a Map with all the beans of type DiscordCommand in the application, using the bean name (the command string in this case) as the key. We will use this to map any command received to this bean. To use the map, there is a controller who listens for upcoming commands, the interactions endpoint @RestController class InteractionsController( private val commands: Map<String, DiscordCommand> ) { @PostMapping(\"/discord/interactions\") fun execute(@RequestBody interaction: Interaction): InteractionResponse { return commands[interaction.command]?.accept(interaction) ?: defaultResponse() } //ACK Discord PING checks private fun defaultResponse() = InteractionResponse() } Discord requires this endpoint to receive upcoming commands. In production, this endpoint is protected by a reverse proxy to only allow requests coming from discord. The proxy will require a header with the request encrypted with a private key owned by discord. This class is located at the following package: com.datocal.nolocal.infrastructure.discord.controller.InteractionsController The registration on commands via discord works by a bean with a @PostConstruct annotation that register the command via api, using the class in: com.datocal.nolocal.infrastructure.discord.CommandRegistrator","title":"Adding Commands"},{"location":"devguide/addingCommands/#adding-commands","text":"","title":"Adding commands"},{"location":"devguide/addingCommands/#registering-commands","text":"To make a command available in the server it's needed to register it in the discord API.

Redis has multiple strategies to write data to disk. The chosen one is the default persistence, Redis Database (RDB). By default it will save snapshots of the dataset each 60 seconds. It may seem weak, but it should not be an issue at all, worst case scenario would be a lost of 60 seconds of data and with few users it will be acceptable. However, having the redis dockerized inside a Virtual Machine forces to maintain a process to keep the data in another point to be able to destroy the machine and create another. That's where several technologies come into play: Redis : The official redis image from dockerhub . Oracle Object Storage : AWS S3 like bucket. Used to store the redis dumps. S3FS : Tool to mount S3 buckets into a file system. Docker volumes : A volume is created from a container using s3fs linking the host with the bucket. Another mount is made to link that host's folder to the redis container.

Redis has multiple strategies to write data to disk. The chosen one is the default persistence, Redis Database (RDB). By default it will save snapshots of the dataset each 60 seconds. It may seem weak, but it should not be an issue at all, worst case scenario would be a lost of 60 seconds of data and with few users it will be acceptable. However, having the redis dockerized inside a Virtual Machine forces to maintain a process to keep the data in another point to be able to destroy the machine and create another. That's where several technologies come into play: Redis : The official redis image from dockerhub . Oracle Object Storage : AWS S3 like bucket. Used to store the redis dumps. S3FS : Tool to mount S3 buckets into a file system. Docker volumes : A volume is created from a container using s3fs linking the host with the bucket.
